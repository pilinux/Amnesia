# Amnesia
Amnesia carries out DDoS (Dedicated Denial Of Service) attacks. It is a Perl Script

# Installation

1. Open your terminal, or connect to your vps

2. Type "git clone https://github.com/MurmurNBB/Amnesia.git" without quotations.

3. You've successfully downloaded the tool!

# Give permissions and Initial Setup

Type the following commands;

1. cd Amnesia

2. chmod +x Amnesia.pl

Usage:

1. First, do "cd Amnesia" without quotations if you aren't already in the directory.

2. Now, do "./Amnesia.pl" without quotations.

3. Input the IP you want to DDoS.

4. Amnesia will do it's best in hitting the IP offline, but be nice; Sometimes the IP is too powerful and Amnesia forgets!

# Extra Info

For the port, I recommend using 80, 22, or 443; However, You can use Nmap to scan an IP for open ports to use.

Choose TCP or UDP (Normally I use UDP).

Use Amnesia responsibly, I am not held responsible for anything you do with Amnesia and it is your responsibility and solely yours.

Want to end the attack? Hold CTRL + C down at the same time and the script will end.
